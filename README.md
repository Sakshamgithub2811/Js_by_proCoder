ðŸŽ¯ Message to Beginners
If you're just starting out, I highly recommend sticking to one quality resource throughout your learning journey.
The goal isn't to master JavaScript in a day â€” that was one of my biggest mistakes early on.
Instead, focus on becoming 1% better every day. Consistency beats intensity.
